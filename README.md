# React CV Builder

A React application for building and previewing a CV/resume. This project allows users to enter their general information, educational background, and practical experience through separate, modular form components. After filling out the forms, users can preview their resume in a nicely formatted layout, complete with inline styling that mimics a traditional resume.
